## Gameplay
The gameplay in this program is based on a duel between two characters, where one is either controlled by the user or a bot created by the program. The game starts by asking the user if they want to create a bot or a character. If the user chooses to create a character, they are prompted to enter the name, class (Cleric or Warrior), weapon, and treasure for their character. The weapon and treasure options are presented to the player, and the user chooses from among them. Once the character has been created, they will be able to fight the bot or the other player. The player will be able to see their health and attack points, which will be used to attack the opponent in a turn-based manner. The game ends when one of the characters loses all their health points or when a player fled for the battle.
